# BFDA
An R package for Bayes Factor Design Analysis
This is a modified version of the original BFDA package (https://github.com/nicebread/BFDA), which also allows interval null hypotheses.
Bayef factors for intervall null hypothesis tests are calculated with the ttestBF function from the BayesFactor package.
